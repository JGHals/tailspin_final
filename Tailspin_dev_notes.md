# üåÄ TailSpin ‚Äì Developer Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
You are an expert in TypeScript, Next.js App Router, React, and Tailwind. Follow @Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing. 

My project is already set up as a Next.js app in Replit.
The UI/theme has been imported from V0. please look in directory _v0_reference for reference UI files to model our app after

I want to keep the existing UI as-is ‚Äî design, structure, elements, and styles ‚Äî and now start building the backend and game logic for the app to support that front end. 

Important:

    Do NOT modify or re-render the UI ‚Äî all logic should integrate with existing components - please update code if you have to, but please notify me first and don't create new files without asking. 

    Keep everything modular so I can scale later (e.g. with multiplayer)

Please scaffold the initial files and logic needed to support this backend flow while preserving the front-end theme.

Your job is to create a Tailspin, a word-chaining game where players build chains of words with each new word starting EXACTLY with the last two letters of the previous word (e.g., "puzzle" ‚Üí "lethal" ‚Üí "alliance"):

TailSpin is a word-chaining game built with Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The game challenges players to build chains of words where each new word must start with the last two letters of the previous word.

## 2. Game Mechanics

### Core Word Chaining Rule
- Each word must start with the exact last two letters of the previous word
- Each word must be an english language, this is not a limitation but intended
- Each word must NOT BE a proper noun, also intended
- Example: "puzzle" ‚Üí "lethal" ‚Üí "alliance"

### Scoring System
Currently implemented scoring rules:

```typescript
const defaultScoringRules = {
  basePoints: 10,
  lengthBonus: 5,        // Per letter beyond 4 letters
  rareLetterBonus: 15,   // For Q, Z, X, J
  streakBonus: 10,       // For consecutive valid words
  terminalBonus: 50,     // For reaching a terminal word
  speedBonus: 20,        // For moves under 5 seconds
  dailyBonus: {
    completion: 100,
    underPar: 50,
    fastSolve: 75,
    rareLetters: 25
  },
  penalties: {
    invalidAttempt: -5,
    hintUsed: -10,
    powerUpUsed: -5
  }
};
```

### Terminal Words
- Words that end in combinations no valid English word starts with
- Handled differently per game mode:
  - Daily Challenge: Not allowed (except target word)
  - Endless Mode: Celebrated as achievements
  - Versus Mode: Counted for scoring but don't end game

### Power-Up System

### Overview
The game features five distinct power-ups that provide strategic advantages during gameplay. Each power-up costs tokens and is managed by the `PowerUpSystem` class.

### Available Power-Ups

1. **Hint** (üîç Suggestion System)
   - **Cost**: 3 tokens
   - **Function**: Shows valid next word suggestions that follow the chain rule
   - **Implementation**: `usePowerUps.getHint()`
   - **UI**: Yellow lightbulb icon
   - **Use Case**: When stuck and need valid word options

2. **Undo** (‚Ü©Ô∏è Rewind)
   - **Cost**: 4 tokens
   - **Function**: Removes the last word from the chain
   - **Implementation**: `usePowerUps.performUndo()`
   - **UI**: Orange undo icon
   - **Use Case**: Correct mistakes or try different paths

3. **Word Warp** (ü™Ñ Combo Selector)
   - **Cost**: 10 tokens
   - **Function**: Select any valid 2-letter combo to continue chain
   - **Implementation**: `usePowerUps.performWordWarp()`
   - **UI**: Blue wand icon
   - **Use Case**: Strategic path changes in challenging situations

4. **Flip** (‚ÜîÔ∏è Letter Reversal)
   - **Cost**: 5 tokens
   - **Function**: Inverts the current 2-letter combo if valid
   - **Implementation**: `usePowerUps.performFlip()`
   - **UI**: Purple flip icon
   - **Use Case**: Quick exploration of reversed letter combinations

5. **Bridge** (üåâ Wildcard Word)
   - **Cost**: 7 tokens
   - **Function**: Places a validated wildcard word to continue chain
   - **Implementation**: `usePowerUps.performBridge()`
   - **UI**: Amber brackets icon
   - **Use Case**: Particularly useful in Daily Challenge for reaching target words

### Implementation Details

#### Core Components
- `PowerUpSystem` class (`src/lib/game/power-up-system.ts`)
  - Manages costs and validation
  - Handles user inventory
  - Integrates with game state
  - Provides error handling

#### UI Components
- `PowerUpBar`: Main game interface component
- `PowerUpInfoModal`: Detailed descriptions and costs
- `PowerUpMenu`: Alternative compact view

#### Integration Points
- Firebase persistence
- User profile management
- Token economy system
- Achievement tracking

#### Usage Flow
1. User selects power-up from UI
2. System validates:
   - Token balance
   - Power-up availability
   - Usage conditions
3. If valid:
   - Apply power-up effect
   - Deduct tokens
   - Update game state
   - Provide feedback
4. If invalid:
   - Show error message
   - Maintain current state

### Token Costs
```typescript
const powerUpCosts = {
  hint: 3,
  undo: 4,
  wordWarp: 10,
  flip: 5,
  bridge: 7
};
```

### Error Handling
- Insufficient tokens
- Invalid game state
- Usage restrictions
- Network issues
- State conflicts

### Game Mode Interactions

#### Daily Challenge
- All power-ups available
- Higher strategic value for Bridge
- Cost/benefit important for scoring

#### Endless Mode
- All power-ups available
- Focus on chain continuation
- Terminal word recovery

#### Versus Mode (Future)
- Power-up usage affects scoring
- Tactical advantages in competition
- Real-time effects on opponent

## 3. Game Modes

### Daily Challenge
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
- Start word and target word provided
- Par moves system for scoring
- One attempt per day per user
- Leaderboard integration

### Endless Mode
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
- Random start word generation
- Terminal word discovery tracking
- Progressive difficulty
- Achievement system integration

### Versus Mode
- **Status**: üöß Partially Implemented
- Real-time multiplayer via Firebase
- Shared start word
- Time-limited matches
- Score-based winning condition

## 4. Dictionary Management System

### Architecture
The dictionary system uses a dual-layer approach:

1. **Local Dictionary (DictionaryService)**
```typescript
class DictionaryService {
  private dictionary: Set<string>;
  private prefixMap: Map<string, string[]>;
  private validPrefixes: Set<string>;
}
```

2. **Firebase Dictionary (FirebaseDictionaryOptimized)**
```typescript
class FirebaseDictionaryOptimized {
  private metadata: DictionaryMetadata;
  private chunkCache: Map<string, WordChunk[]>;
}
```

### Initialization Flow
1. Load core dictionary on app start
2. Build prefix/suffix maps
3. Cache common prefixes
4. Sync with Firebase for multiplayer support

### Performance Optimizations
- In-memory prefix mapping
- Chunk-based loading from Firebase
- Local caching of frequent lookups
- Async validation for large operations

## 5. Word Validation System

### Validation Pipeline
```typescript
async function validateWord(
  word: string,
  chain: string[],
  gameMode?: GameMode
): Promise<WordValidationResult>
```

1. Basic Validation
   - Length check
   - Character validity

2. Dictionary Check
   - Word existence
   - Prefix/suffix validation

3. Chain Rule Validation
   - Last two letters matching
   - No duplicates in chain

4. Mode-Specific Validation
   - Terminal word handling
   - Daily challenge constraints
   - Versus mode rules

### Validation Result Structure
```typescript
interface WordValidationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  word: string;
  errors?: ValidationError[];
  isTerminalWord: boolean;
  matchesLastWord?: boolean;
  stats?: WordStats;
  suggestedWords?: string[];
}
```

## 6. Game Session Management

### State Management
Core game state is managed by `GameStateManager`:

```typescript
interface GameState {
  mode: GameMode;
  chain: string[];
  startWord: string;
  targetWord?: string;
  isComplete: boolean;
  score: GameScore;
  wordTimings: Map<string, number>;
  terminalWords: Set<string>;
  powerUpsUsed: Set<string>;
  rareLettersUsed: Set<string>;
  // ... additional state fields
}
```

### Session Persistence
- Auto-save every 30 seconds
- Save on significant state changes
- Resume capability for incomplete games
- Daily challenge progress tracking

## 7. Achievement System

Currently implemented achievements:

### Daily Challenge
- Under Par: Complete below par moves
- Speed Demon: Complete under 2 minutes
- Perfect Line: No mistakes or hints
- Rare Letter Master: Use 3+ rare letters

### Endless Mode
- Chain Master: 25+ word chain
- Word Wizard: 50+ word chain
- Dead End Collector: Find 5 terminal words
- Alphabet Explorer: Use 20+ unique letters
