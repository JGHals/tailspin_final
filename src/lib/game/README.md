# TailSpin Game State Architecture

## Architecture Overview
The game state system uses a multi-tiered approach optimized for performance, reliability, and offline support. Each layer serves a specific purpose in the game's architecture, working together to provide fast UI responses while maintaining data integrity and game state.

## Component Responsibilities

### GameManager (Orchestration Layer)
Located in `src/lib/game/game-manager.ts`

Primary responsibility: Orchestrate game state operations and coordinate between layers
- State orchestration and initialization
- Error handling and recovery coordination
- Power-up system integration
- Game flow control
- User interaction management

Key Features:
- Unified API for game operations
- Coordinated state updates
- Error boundary implementation
- Power-up management

### GameStateManager (Core Layer)
Located in `src/lib/game/game-state.ts`

Primary responsibility: Manage core game mechanics and real-time state
- Real-time state management
- Game mechanics implementation
- UI state coordination
- Achievement tracking
- Score calculation

Key Features:
- Fast, synchronous operations
- Game rule enforcement
- UI state management
- Real-time feedback

### GameStateService (Persistence Layer)
Located in `src/lib/services/game-state-service.ts`

Primary responsibility: Handle Firebase persistence and cross-device synchronization
- Cross-device state persistence
- User data management
- Error logging
- State versioning
- Daily challenge cleanup

Key Features:
- Reliable data persistence
- Cross-device gameplay support
- Error tracking
- Game state versioning

### GamePersistenceService (Auto-save Layer)
Located in `src/lib/services/game-persistence.ts`

Primary responsibility: Manage automatic saving and state recovery
- Automatic state saving
- Offline support
- State reconstruction
- Local storage backup
- Error recovery

Key Features:
- Configurable auto-save intervals
- Offline gameplay support
- State reconstruction
- Backup management

## Usage Patterns

### UI Components
```typescript
// Fast, synchronous operations for UI feedback
const gameManager = new GameManager(userId);

// Get current state
const state = gameManager.getState();

// Add word with automatic persistence
await gameManager.addWord(word);
```

### Game Logic
```typescript
// Initialize game with persistence
const manager = new GameManager(userId);
await manager.initialize('daily');

// Handle game actions with automatic state management
const result = await manager.addWord(word);
if (result.success) {
  // State is automatically persisted
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
1. In-Memory State (GameStateManager)
   - Real-time game state
   - UI state management
   - Immediate feedback

2. Local Storage (GamePersistenceService)
   - Auto-save backup
   - Offline support
   - Quick recovery

3. Firebase Backend (GameStateService)
   - Source of truth
   - Cross-device sync
   - Analytics and monitoring

### Offline Support
- Local state ensures gameplay continues without network
- Auto-save to localStorage
- Automatic reconciliation on reconnect

### Network Optimization
- Batched Firebase operations
- Configurable auto-save intervals
- Optimistic UI updates

## Implementation Guidelines

### When to Use Each Layer

1. Use GameManager for:
   - Starting new games
   - Adding words
   - Using power-ups
   - Getting game state

2. Use GameStateManager for:
   - Game rule validation
   - Score calculation
   - Achievement tracking
   - UI state updates

3. Use GameStateService for:
   - Cross-device persistence
   - User data management
   - Error logging
   - Analytics

4. Use GamePersistenceService for:
   - Auto-save configuration
   - Offline support
   - State recovery
   - Backup management

## Error Handling

Each layer implements appropriate error handling:

1. GameManager
   - Coordinates recovery
   - Provides feedback
   - Maintains consistency

2. GameStateManager
   - Validates state transitions
   - Enforces game rules
   - Tracks errors

3. GameStateService
   - Handles network errors
   - Logs issues
   - Manages retries

4. GamePersistenceService
   - Provides fallback storage
   - Recovers from failures
   - Maintains backups

## Testing Strategy

Each component has dedicated tests:
- Unit tests for individual layers
- Integration tests for layer interaction
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Network resilience tests

## Future Considerations

The multi-tiered architecture supports:
- New game modes
- Enhanced analytics
- Performance optimizations
- Cross-platform support
- Multiplayer features
